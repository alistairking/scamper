.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides the ability to connect to a running
.Xr scamper 1
instance and use it to periodically probe a set of addresses at a
defined interval, and periodically rotate the output file at a defined
interval.
The supported options to
.Nm
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a Ar addrfile
specifies the name of the input file which consists of a sequence of
IP addresses to probe, one address per line.
.It Fl c Ar command
specifies the command to use with each address.
.Nm
supports the trace and ping commands, and their options, in scamper.
.Xr scamper 1
documents the options available in trace and ping.
.It Fl I Ar interval
specifies the probe interval, in seconds, between probing each address.
.Nm
will spread the probing of the addresses across the interval.
If there are 10 addresses to probe at an interval of 20 seconds, then
.Nm
will issue a command every two seconds.
.It Fl l Ar logfile
specifies the name of a file to log progress output from
.Nm
generated at run time.
.It Fl o Ar outfile
specifies the prefix of the name of the output file to be written.
The output file will use the
.Xr warts 5
format.
.Nm
will create a sequence of files named using the prefix and a timestamp.
.It Fl O Ar options
allows the behavior of
.Nm
to be further tailored.
The current choices for this option are:
.Bl -dash -offset 2n -compact -width 1n
.It
.Sy noshuffle:
do not shuffle the order of addresses before probing starts.
.It
.Sy nooutfile:
do not write to warts files, just do the probing.
.El
.It Fl p Ar port
specifies the port on the local host where
.Xr scamper 1
is accepting control socket connections.
.It Fl R Ar rotation
specifies the rotation interval, in seconds, between rotating output
files.
.It Fl U Ar unix
specifies the name of a unix domain socket where
.Xr scamper 1
is accepting control socket connections.
.El

.Sh EXAMPLES
Given a set of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses contained in a file named
addrs and a scamper process listening at sock
configured to probe at 100 packets per second started as follows:
.Pp
.Dl scamper -U sock -p 100
.Pp
the following command will ping the addresses every two minutes using
one packet, and create an output file every thirty seconds prefixed
with foo:
.Pp
.Dl sc_erosprober -U sock -a addrs -o foo -I 120 -R 30 -c 'ping -c 1'
.Pp
The following command will traceroute towards the addresses every 15
minutes, creating an output file every minute:
.Pp
.Dl sc_erosprober -U sock -a addrs -o foo -I 900 -R 60 -c 'trace'
.Pp
