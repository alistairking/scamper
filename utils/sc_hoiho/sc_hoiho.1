.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility automatically learns regular expressions that extract router
names or autonomous system numbers (ASNs) from hostnames.
A regular expression that extracts a router name from a router
hostname can be used to infer which interfaces belong to the same
router (are aliases).
A regular expression that extracts an ASN from a router hostname can
be used to infer which AS operates the router.
.Pp
To learn these regular expressions,
.Nm
uses a set of training routers whose interfaces were inferred to be
aliases, optionally annotated with their operating ASN.
The core of the technique is described in the paper "Learning to
Extract Router Names from Hostnames" published in the ACM Internet
Measurement Conference (IMC) 2019.
The technique that learns to extract ASNs is described in the paper
"Learning to Extract and Use ASNs in Hostnames" published in IMC 2020.
The supported options to
.Nm
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 6
specifies that the input training set contains IPv6 addresses, and not
IPv4 addresses.
.It Fl d Ar dump
specifies the dump ID to use to analyze the collected data.
Currently, ID values 1 (working-set), 2 (routers), 3 (best-regex),
4 (interfaces) are valid, which (1) dump the working set of regexes for each
suffix, (2) the router-level result of applying the best regexes to the
training data, (3) the best regex per domain, and (4) the interface-level
result of applying the best regexes to the training data,
respectively.
.It Fl D Ar domain
specifies the domain suffix that
.Nm
should operate on.  If no suffix is specified, then
.Nm
operates on all suffixes.
.It Fl O Ar option
allows the behavior of
.Nm
to be further tailored.
The current choices for this option are:
.Bl -dash -offset 2n -compact -width 1n
.It
.Sy application:
Show the outcome of applying the regular expressions to the application set.
.It
.Sy debug:
output significant volumes of debugging information.  Debugging
information is only printed when a
.Nm
is using a single thread.
.It
.Sy json:
Output inferences using json format.  This option is only applicable on
dump ID 2.
.It
.Sy noed1:
Do not infer true positives between extracted and inferred ASNs where the
ASNs have an edit distance of one.
.It
.Sy noip:
Do not infer the location of an embedded IP address portion, if any, in
the hostname.
.It
.Sy nojit:
Do not use
.Xr pcre 3
or
.Xr pcre2 3
just in time complication to improve regex performance.
.It
.Sy norefine:
do not do any refinement of regular expressions.
.It
.Sy norefine-tp, refine-tp:
do not, or do, execute the phase that builds literals into components
that extract a string from the hostnames.  This phase is described in
phase 5.2 of the IMC 2019 paper.
.It
.Sy norefine-fne, refine-fne:
do not, or do, execute the phase that embeds literals in a regex component
that separates hostnames from their training routers.  This phase
is described in section 5.3 of the IMC 2019 paper.
.It
.Sy norefine-class, refine-class:
do not, or do, execute the phase that embeds character classes in regular
expressions.  This phase is described in section 5.4 of the IMC 2019 paper.
.It
.Sy norefine-fnu, refine-fnu:
do not, or do, execute the phase that builds additional regexes to use as a
companion regex with another regex that did not cluster all interfaces
on a router.  This phase is described in section 5.5 of the IMC 2019 paper.
.It
.Sy norefine-sets, refine-sets:
do not, or do, execute the phase that builds naming convention sets using the
regexes in the working set.  This phase is described in section 5.6 of
the IMC 2019 paper.
.It
.Sy norefine-ip, refine-ip:
do not, or do, execute the phase that builds regexes to filter hostnames with
IP addresses in them, where the IP address would be part of an
extracted name.  This phase is described in section 5.7 of the IMC 2019 paper.
.It
.Sy norefine-fp, refine-fp:
do not, or do, execute the phase that builds regexes to filter hostnames that,
if matched, would result in false positives according to the training
data.  This phase is described in phase 5.7 of the IMC 2019 paper.
.It
.Sy norefine-merge, refine-merge:
do not, or do, execute the phase that merges regular expressions that
differ by a single simple string.  This phase is described in section
3.3 of the IMC 2020 paper.
.It
.Sy nothin:
do not, or do, remove any redundant regexes at the end of each phase, as
described in section 4.5 of the IMC 2019 paper.
.It
.Sy nothin-matchc, thin-matchc:
do not, or do, remove any regexes that do not meet the minimum number
of matches to be considered capturing a convention.  The conditions
are described in section 4.5 of the IMC 2019 paper.
.It
.Sy nothin-same, thin-same:
do not, or do, remove redundant regexes that make the same inferences.
.It
.Sy nothin-mask, thin-mask:
do not, or do, remove redundant regexes whose inferences are entirely
contained in another regex, with no additional false positives.
.It
.Sy randindex:
compute the Rand Index metric on the clustering of hostnames by router
name regexes according to the training data.
.It
.Sy show-class:
only show hostnames where
.Nm
made a classification using a regex.
.It
.Sy show-good:
only show regexes
.Nm
would classify as good.
.It
.Sy learnasn:
infer regexes to extract AS numbers from hostnames.
.It
.Sy learnalias:
infer regexes to extract router names from hostnames.
.It
.Sy loadonly:
load the training data into memory and then exit.
.El
.It Fl r Ar regex
specifies the name of a file containing a working set of regexes, or a
naming convention, to apply.
.It Fl S Ar siblings
specifies the name of a file containing sibling ASes.
Each line in the file contains a list of sibling ASes that belong to the
same organization.
.It Fl t Ar threadc
specifies the number of threads to use in the threadpool.  By default,
.Nm
will determine the number of processors online, and use all of them.

Then the following command will build a base set of regular
expressions that extract router names, as described in section 5.1 of
the IMC 2019 paper, and output the working set of regexes inferred for
each suffix at the end of that phase.
.Pp
sc_hoiho -O learnalias -d working-set -O norefine public_suffix_list.dat routers.txt
.Pp
To obtain the best selected regular expression that extracts router names
for example.net, use:
.Pp
sc_hoiho -O learnalias -d best-regex -D example.net public_suffix_list.dat routers.txt
.Pp
To examine how the best regular expression that extracts router names
applies to the training data for example.net, use:
.Pp
sc_hoiho -O learnalias -d routers -D example.net public_suffix_list.dat routers.txt
.Pp
To examine how the best regular expression that extracts router names
applies to the training data, as well as interfaces in the application
set, use:
.Pp
sc_hoiho -O learnalias -d routers -D example.net -O application
public_suffix_list.dat routers.txt
.Pp
To see the working set of regular expressions that extract router names
built after embedding literals in captures for example.net, use:
.Pp
sc_hoiho -O learnalias -d working-set -D example.net -O norefine -O refine-tp
public_suffix_list.dat routers.txt
.Pp
To see how a manually-derived regular expression clusters hostnames

.\""""""""""""
.Sh HINTS
.Nm
can take a long time to run when inferring regular expressions that extract
router names, depending on the training set involved.
One option to breaking up the runtime (but not reducing it) is to
capture the output from one phase, and then use that as input to the
next phase.  For example, to run the first three phases:
.Pp
sc_hoiho -O learnalias -d working-set -O norefine public_suffix_list.dat routers.txt
>phase-1.re
.Pp
sc_hoiho -O learnalias -d working-set -O norefine -O refine-tp -r phase-1.re
public_suffix_list.dat routers.txt >phase-2.re
.Pp
sc_hoiho -O learnalias -d working-set -O norefine -O refine-fne -r phase-2.re
public_suffix_list.dat routers.txt >phase-3.re
.Pp
.\""""""""""""
.Sh NOTES
.Pp
.Nm
follows the format of the hostnames files stored in CAIDA's Internet
Topology Data Kit (ITDK) which stores hostnames in lower-case, and
stores characters that do not form part of the DNS's alphabet
(A-Z, a-z, - and .) as a hexadecimal escaped string.
For example, if a hostname contains an underscore character, such
as foo_bar, then encode the underscore using the hexadecimal dictionary
in
.Xr ascii 7
as follows: foo\\x5fbar.
.Pp
When learning ASN regexes,
.Nm
can take an optional parameter that specifies which ASNs belong
to the same organization (are siblings).  Each line specifies ASNs
that belong to the same organization.  For example, a file with
the following contents:
.Pp
.in +.3i
.nf
64504 64505 64506
.br
64507 64508
.fi
.in -.3i
.Pp
defines the ASNs operated by two organizations: one organization
with ASes 64504, 64505, and 64506, and the other organization
with ASes 64507 and 64508.
