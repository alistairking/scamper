.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides the ability to connect to a running
.Xr scamper 1
instance and run ping on a set of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
For each address in the file,
.Nm
will try ICMP, UDP, and TCP-ack probe methods to solicit responses from the
address.
.Nm
will not try all methods if one method obtains responses.
The output of
.Nm
is written to a
.Xr warts 5
file, which can then be processed to extract details of responses.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl ?
prints a list of command line options and a synopsis of each.
.It Fl D
causes
.Nm
to detach and become a daemon.
.It Fl a Ar infile
specifies the name of the input file which consists of a sequence of
IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, one per line.
.It Fl c Ar probe-count
specifies the number of probes to send for each method.
.Nm
accepts two formats: a single integer that specifies the number of
probes (and responses) desired; or, two integers, separated by /,
that specify the number of responses desired and maximum number of
probes to send.
By default,
.Nm
seeks three responses from up to five probes.
.It Fl l Ar limit
specifies the number of objects to write to an output file, before
closing it and opening the next file.
The output file must contain a %u format specifier, which
.Nm
uses to embed a counter value that increments with each new output file.
If the user uses the move option,
.Nm
moves the file when it closes the file.
.It Fl m Ar method
specifies a single probe method to try.
The available probe methods are the same as scamper's ping implementation,
listed in
.Xr scamper 1
manual page.
By default,
.Nm
uses ICMP-echo, UDP-dport, and TCP-ack-sport to destination port 80.
.It Fl M Ar move-dir
specifies the name of the directory to move completed files to.
By default,
.Nm
leaves completed files in place.
.It Fl o Ar outfile
specifies the name of the output file to be written.
The output file will use the
.Xr warts 5
format.
.It Fl p Ar port
specifies the port on the local host where
.Xr scamper 1
is accepting control socket connections.
.It Fl R Ar unix-remote
specifies the name of a unix domain socket on the local host where a remote
.Xr scamper 1
instance is accepting commands.
.It Fl t Ar logfile
specifies the name of a file to log output from
.Nm
generated at run time.
.It Fl U Ar unix-local
specifies the name of a unix domain socket on the local host where a local
.Xr scamper 1
instance is accepting commands.

.Sh EXAMPLES
Given a set of IPv4 and IPv6 address sets in a file named infile.txt:
.Pp
.in +.3i
.nf
192.0.2.1
192.0.32.10
192.0.31.60
2001:db8::1
.fi
.in -.3i
.Pp
and a
.Xr scamper 1
daemon listening on port 31337, then these addresses can be probed
using
.Pp
.Dl sc_pinger -a infile.txt -o outfile.warts -p 31337
.Pp
To send 4 probes, and stop after receiving two responses:
.Pp
.Dl sc_pinger -a infile.txt -o outfile.warts -p 31337 -c 2/4
.Pp
To use ICMP-echo and TCP-syn probes to destination port 443
.Pp
.Dl sc_pinger -a infile.txt -o outfile.warts -p 31337 -m icmp-echo -m 'tcp-syn -d 443'
.Pp
The following command writes a series of gzip-compressed
.Xr warts 5
files, each of which have up to 1000 objects in them, with names such
as outfile_0000.warts.gz, outfile_0001.warts.gz, moving them to the
finished directory:
.Pp
.Dl sc_pinger -a infile.txt -o outfile_%04u.warts.gz -p 31337 -l 1000 -m finished
.Pp
A user can concatenate these files into a final bzip2-compressed
.Xr warts 5
file with
.Xr sc_wartscat 1 :
.Pp
.Dl sc_wartscat -o outfile_final.warts.bz2 outfile_0000.warts.gz outfile_0001.warts.gz
.Pp
