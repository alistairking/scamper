.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides the ability to execute Internet measurement techniques
to IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, in parallel, to fill a specified
packets-per-second rate.  Currently,
.Nm
supports the well-known traceroute and ping techniques, DNS,
as well as MDA traceroute, alias resolution, some parts of tbit, sting,
and neighbour discovery.
.Pp
.Nm
has five modes of operation.
First,
.Nm
can be supplied a list of one or more addresses on the command line with the
.Fl i
option.
.Nm
will then execute a command with each of the supplied addresses, in parallel,
and output the results as each task completes.
Second,
.Nm
can be supplied a list of one or more addresses in a listfile, one
address per line, using the
.Fl f
option.
Third,
.Nm
can be supplied a list of one or more complete commands on the command
line with the
.Fl I
option.
Fourth,
.Nm
can be instructed to listen on an IP address and port specified with the
.Fl P
option, or on a unix domain socket specified with the
.Fl U
option, where it can take commands dynamically.
Finally,
.Nm
can be instructed to connect to a remote host and port specified with the
.Fl R
option, where it will be supplied with commands dynamically.
.Pp
For most modules,
.Nm
must be run as root.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl ?
prints a list of command line options and a synopsis of each.
.It Fl v
causes
.Nm
to output version information and exit.
.It Fl D
With this option set,
.Nm
will detach and become a daemon.  Use with the
.Fl P
or
.Fl U
options.
.It Fl c Ar command
specifies the command for
.Nm
to use by default. The current choices for this option are:
.Bl -dash -offset 2n -compact -width 1n
.It
.Sy dealias:
use Ally, Mercator, MIDAR, or Radargun-style probing to infer which IP
addresses belong to the same system.
.It
.Sy http:
perform an HTTP request.
.It
.Sy host:
issue simple DNS queries to a domain name server.
.It
.Sy neighbourdisc:
issue an IPv4 ARP or IPv6 Neighbour discovery query to determine the
layer-2 address of an IP address on the same network.
.It
.Sy ping:
conduct simple delay measurements with various probe types.
.It
.Sy trace:
conduct classic and Paris-style traceroute probing, which infers a
single path towards a destination.
.It
.Sy tracelb:
use the multipath discovery algorithm (MDA) to infer the presence
of load-balanced paths towards a destination.
.It
.Sy sniff:
capture a subset of packets arriving at the host using a subset of
tcpdump-style filter expressions.
.It
.Sy sting:
use the sting method to infer one-way packet loss with a TCP receiver.
.It
.Sy tbit:
use techniques from the TCP behavior inference tool (TBIT) to infer
properties of a TCP receiver.
.It
.Sy udpprobe:
sends a single UDP probe and waits for a response.
.El
.Nm
uses trace by default.
The options for each of these commands are documented in their own
sections of this manual page.
.It Fl p Ar pps
specifies the target packets-per-second rate for
.Nm
to reach.  By default, this value is 20.
.It Fl w Ar window
specifies the maximum number of tasks that may be probed in parallel.
A value of zero places no upper limit.
By default, zero is used.
.It Fl M Ar monitorname
specifies the canonical name of machine where
.Nm
is run.
This value is used when recording the output in a warts output file.
.It Fl l Ar listname
specifies the name of the list when run from the command line.
This value is used when recording the output in a warts output file.
.It Fl L Ar listid
specifies the numerical id of the list when run from the command line.
This value is used when recording the output in a warts output file.
.It Fl C Ar cycleid
specifies the numerical cycle id to begin with when run from the command line.
This value is used when recording the output in a warts output file.
.It Fl o Ar outfile
specifies the default output file to write measurement results to.  By
default, stdout is used.
.It Fl F Ar firewall
specifies that
.Nm
may use the firewall in measurements that require it
(tbit and sting).
.Nm
supports two firewall types: IPFW, and PF.
To use the IPFW firewall, pass ipfw:<start>-<end>, where <start> is
the first rule
.Nm
can use, and <end> is the last.
To use the PF firewall, pass pf:<anchor>:<num>, where <anchor> is the
anchor for
.Nm
to use, and <num> specifies the number of rules
.Nm
is allowed to use.
.It Fl n Ar nameserver
specifies the nameserver for
.Nm
to use.  By default,
.Nm
uses the first nameserver specified in /etc/resolv.conf
.It Fl d Ar debugfile
specifies a filename to write debugging messages to.  By default, no
debugfile is used, though debugging output is sent to stderr if scamper is
built for debugging.
.It Fl e Ar pidfile
specifies a file to write scamper's process ID to.
If scamper is built with privilege separation, the ID of the unprivileged
process is written.
.It Fl O Ar options
allows scamper's behaviour to be further tailored.
The options are case insensitive.
The current choices for this option are:
.Bl -dash -offset 2n -compact -width 1n
.It
.Sy text:
output results in plain text.  Suitable for interactive use.
.It
.Sy warts:
output results in
.Xr warts 5
format.  Suitable for archiving measurement
results and for use by researchers as it records details that cannot be
easily represented with the text option.
.It
.Sy warts.gz:
output results in
.Xr warts 5
format, compressed with
.Xr gzip 1 .
.It
.Sy warts.bz2:
output results in
.Xr warts 5
format, compressed with
.Xr bzip2 1 .
.It
.Sy warts.xz:
output results in
.Xr warts 5
format, compressed with
.Xr xz 1 .
.It
.Sy json:
output results in JSON format.  Suitable for processing measurement
results with a scripting language.  A better approach is to output
results in
.Xr warts 5
format, and to use
.Xr sc_warts2json 1
to convert warts to JSON.
The JSON format is documented in
.Xr sc_warts2json 1 .
.It
.Sy planetlab:
tell scamper it is running on a planetlab system.  Necessary to use
planetlab's safe raw sockets.
.It
.Sy rawtcp:
tell scamper to use IPPROTO_RAW socket to send IPv4 TCP probes, rather than
a datalink socket.
.It
.Sy ICMP-rxerr:
tell scamper to use IP_RECVERR or IPV6_RECVERR to receive ICMP
responses, rather than raw sockets.  This is useful on Linux systems
that have these sockets, and scamper does not have the permissions to
obtain a raw socket.  This option currently only works with the trace
command.
.It
.Sy select:
tell scamper to use
.Xr select 2
rather than
.Xr poll 2
.It
.Sy kqueue:
tell scamper to use
.Xr kqueue 2
rather than
.Xr poll 2
on systems where
.Xr kqueue 2
is available.
.It
.Sy epoll:
tell scamper to use
.Xr epoll 7
rather than
.Xr poll 2
on systems where
.Xr epoll 7
is available.
.It
.Sy ring:
tell scamper to create a memory-mapped ring buffer to receive datalink
responses. This significantly improves scamper performance and
accuracy on Linux systems with other non-scamper traffic. See
.Xr packet 7
for further details.
.It
.Sy cmdfile:
the input file consists of complete commands.
.It
.Sy noinitndc:
do not initialise the neighbour discovery cache.
.It
.Sy outcopy:
write a copy of all data written by scamper with the default output method.
.It
.Sy debugfileappend:
append to the debugfile specified with the
.Fl d
option.  The default is to truncate the debugfile.
.It
.Sy notls-remote:
do not use TLS when establishing a connection with the remove controller
specified with the
.Fl R
option.
.It
.Sy notls:
do not use TLS anywhere in scamper, including tbit.
.It
.Sy cafile=file:
load the CA certificates in the specified file into scamper, instead of
the default certificates.
.It
.Sy client-certfile=file:
load the certificate in the specified file into scamper and present it
to the remote controller for client authentication.
.It
.Sy client-privfile=file:
load the private key in the specified file into scamper and use it
for client authentication with the remote controller.
.El
.It Fl i Ar IP 1..N
specifies a list of one or more addresses to probe, on the command
line, using the command specified with the
.Fl c
option.
.It Fl f Ar listfile
specifies the input file to read for target addresses, one per line, and
uses the command specified with the
.Fl c
option on each.
.It Fl I Ar cmds
specifies a list of one or more complete commands, including target
addresses, for scamper to execute.
.It Fl P Ar [ip:]port
specifies that
.Nm
provide a control socket listening on the specified IP address and port on
the local host.  If an IP address is not specified,
.Nm
will bind to the port specified on the loopback address.
.It Fl R Ar name:port
specifies that
.Nm
connects to a specified remote host and port to receive commands.
.It Fl U Ar unix domain socket
specifies that
.Nm
provide a control socket listening on the specified socket in the unix
domain.

.Sh TRACE OPTIONS
The trace command is used for conducting classic and Paris-style
traceroute probing, which infers a single path towards a destination.
The following variations of the
.Xr traceroute 8
options are available:
.Pp
trace
.Bk -words
.Op Fl MQT
.Op Fl c Ar confidence
.Op Fl d Ar dport
.Op Fl f Ar firsthop
.Op Fl g Ar gaplimit
.Op Fl G Ar gapaction
.Op Fl H Ar wait-probe-hop
.Op Fl l Ar loops
.Op Fl m Ar maxttl
.Op Fl N Ar squeries
.Op Fl o Ar offset
.Op Fl O Ar option
.Op Fl p Ar payload
.Op Fl P Ar method
.Op Fl q Ar attempts
.Op Fl r Ar rtraddr
.Op Fl s Ar sport
.Op Fl S Ar srcaddr
.Op Fl t Ar tos
.Op Fl U Ar userid
.Op Fl w Ar wait-timeout
.Op Fl W Ar wait-probe
.Op Fl z Ar gss-entry
.Op Fl Z Ar lss-name
.Ek
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar confidence
specifies that a hop should be probed to a specified confidence level
(95% or 99%) to be sure the trace has seen all interfaces that will reply
for that hop.
.It Fl d Ar dport
specifies the base destination port value to use for UDP-based and TCP-based
traceroute methods.  For ICMP-Paris, this option sets the ICMP checksum
value.
.It Fl f Ar firsthop
specifies the TTL or HLIM value to begin probing with.  By default,
a first hop of one is used.
.It Fl g Ar gaplimit
specifies the number of unresponsive hops permitted until a check is made to
see if the destination will respond.  By default, a gap limit of 5 hops is
used.  Setting the gap limit to 0 disables the gap limit, but doing this is
not recommended.
.It Fl G Ar gapaction
specifies what should happen if the gaplimit condition is met.  A value of
1 (default) means halt probing, while a value of 2 means send last-ditch
probes.
.It Fl H Ar wait-probe-hop
specifies the minimum time to wait, in seconds, between sending
consecutive probes that use the same TTL value.  By default, the next
probe is sent as soon as possible after receiving a response to a probe
with a given TTL value.  The limit is 2 seconds.
.It Fl l Ar loops
specifies the maximum number of loops permitted until probing stops.  By
default, a value of one is used.  A value of zero disables loop checking.
.It Fl m Ar maxttl
specifies the maximum TTL or HLIM value that will be probed.  By default,
there is no restriction, apart from the 255 hops that the Internet protocols
allow.
.It Fl M
specifies that path MTU discovery (PMTUD) should be attempted for the path
when the initial traceroute completes.
.Nm
will not conduct PMTUD unless it is probing a responsive destination, as
otherwise there is no way to distinguish all packets being lost from just
big packets (larger than MTU) being lost.
.It Fl N Ar squeries
specifies the number of consecutive hops that may have an outstanding
probe.
By default, only one hop may have an outstanding probe.
Increasing the number of outstanding probes will allow traceroutes to
complete faster, at the expense of sending unnecessary probes.
The number of outstanding probes must be less than the gaplimit.
.It Fl o Ar offset
specifies the fragmentation offset to use in probes.  By default, no
offset is used.
.It Fl O Ar option
specifies optional arguments to use.
The current choices for this option are:
.Bl -dash -offset 2n -compact -width 1n
.It
.Sy const-payload:
specifies that the payload should not be altered in order to arrive
at a desired UDP checksum value for probe/response matching.
.It
.Sy dl:
specifies that the datalink socket should be used to timestamp sent
and received packets.
For apparent UDP responses to UDP-Paris traceroute probes,
.Nm
will assume that any UDP response was for the last sent probe, as it
has no other way of determining which probe the reply might be for.
.It
.Sy dtree-noback:
specifies that the traceroute should not do backwards probing when using
doubletree.
.It
.Sy ptr:
lookup hostnames for intermediate traceroute hops.
.It
.Sy raw:
send IPv4 TCP probes using a raw socket, rather than a datalink interface.
.El
.It Fl p Ar payload
specifies the payload, in hexadecimal, to use as a base in probes.
The first 2 bytes of the payload may be modified to accomplish
ICMP-Paris and UDP-Paris traceroute, unless the traceroute command
was specified with the const-payload option.
.It Fl P Ar method
specifies the traceroute method to use.
.Nm
currently supports five different probe methods: UDP, ICMP, UDP-Paris,
ICMP-Paris, TCP, and TCP-ACK.  Note: scamper uses UDP-Paris by default,
and these options are case insensitive.
.It Fl q Ar attempts
specifies the maximum number of attempts to obtain a response per hop.  By
default, a value of two is used.
.It Fl Q
specifies that all allocated probes are sent, regardless of how many responses
have been received.
.It Fl r Ar rtraddr
specifies the IP address of the router to use.
.It Fl s Ar sport
specifies the source port value to use.  For ICMP-based methods, this option
specifies the ICMP identifier to use.  By default,
.Nm
uses a value it derives from the process ID, but can be told to obtain
a port from the operating system by specifying zero.
.It Fl S Ar srcaddr
specifies the source address to use in probes.
The address cannot be spoofed.
.It Fl t Ar tos
specifies the value to set in the IP ToS/DSCP + ECN byte.  By default, this
byte is set to zero.
.It Fl T
specifies that time exceeded messages from the destination do not cause the
trace to be defined as reaching the destination.
.It Fl U Ar userid
specifies an unsigned integer to include with the data collected; the meaning
of the user-id is entirely up to the user and has no effect on the behaviour
of traceroute.
.It Fl w Ar wait-timeout
specifies how long to wait, in seconds, for a reply.  By default, a value
of 5 is used.
.It Fl W Ar wait-probe
specifies the minimum time to wait, in 10s of milliseconds, between sending
consecutive probes.  By default the next probe is sent as soon as possible.
.It Fl z Ar gss-entry
specifies an IP address to halt probing when encountered; used with the
double-tree algorithm.
.It Fl Z Ar lss-name
specifies the name of the local stop set to use when determining when to
halt probing backwards; used with the double-tree algorithm.
.El
.\""""""""""""
.Sh PING OPTIONS
The ping command is used for conducting simple delay measurements with
various probe types.
The following variations of the
.Xr ping 8
options are available:
.Pp
ping
.Bk -words

.Op Fl T Ar timestamp
.Op Fl U Ar userid
.Op Fl W Ar wait-timeout
.Op Fl z Ar tos
.Ek
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl A Ar TCP-ack
specifies the number to use in the acknowledgement field of the TCP
header when using the TCP-ack, tcp-ack-sport, and TCP-synack methods,
or the number to use in the sequence number field of the TCP header
when using the TCP-syn, TCP-syn-sport, and TCP-rst methods.
.It Fl B Ar payload-size
specifies, in bytes, the size of the payload to include in each probe.
By default,
.Nm
uses 56 bytes for ICMP echo probes, 12 bytes for UDP probes, 44 bytes
for ICMP time probes, and zero bytes for TCP probes.
.It Fl B Ar payload
specifies, in a hexadecimal string, the payload to include in each probe.
.It Fl c Ar probecount
specifies the number of probes to send before exiting.  By default, a value
of 4 is used.
.It Fl C Ar ICMP-sum
specifies the ICMP checksum to use when sending a probe.
The payload of each probe will be manipulated so that the checksum is valid.
.It Fl d Ar dport
specifies the destination port to use in each TCP/UDP probe, and the first
ICMP sequence number to use in ICMP probes.
.It Fl F Ar sport
specifies the source port to use in each TCP/UDP probe, and the ICMP ID to
use in ICMP probes.
By default,
.Nm
uses a value it derives from the process ID, but can be told to obtain
a port from the operating system by specifying zero.
.It Fl i Ar wait-probe
specifies the length of time to wait, in seconds, between probes.  By default,
a value of 1 is used.
.It Fl m Ar ttl
specifies the TTL value to use for outgoing packets.  By default, a value of
64 is used.
.It Fl M Ar MTU
specifies a pseudo MTU value.  If the response packet is larger than the
pseudo MTU, an ICMP packet too big (PTB) message is sent.
.It Fl o Ar replycount
specifies the number of replies required at which time probing may cease.  By
default, all probes are sent.
.It Fl O Ar options
The current choices for this option are:
.Bl -dash -offset 2n -compact -width 1n
.It
.Sy dl:
specifies that the datalink socket should be used to timestamp sent
and received packets.
.It
.Sy nosrc:
specifies that the real address of the host should not be embedded in
the payload of the packet when the spoof option is used.
.It
.Sy raw:
send IPv4 TCP probes using a raw socket, rather than a datalink interface.
.It
.Sy spoof:
specifies that the source address is to be spoofed according to the address
specified with the
.Fl S
option.  The address scamper would otherwise use as the source address is
embedded in the payload of the probe unless the nosrc option is used.
.It
.Sy tbt:
specifies that the goal of the ping is to obtain fragmented responses, so that
the
.Fl c
option specifies how many packets to send, and the
.Fl o
option specifies how many fragmented responses are desired.
.El
.It Fl p Ar pattern
specifies the pattern, in hex, to use in probes.  Up to 16 bytes may be
specified.  By default, each probe's bytes are zeroed.
.It Fl P Ar method
specifies the type of ping packets to send.
By default, ICMP echo requests are sent.
Choices are: ICMP-echo, ICMP-time, TCP-syn, TCP-ack, TCP-ack-sport,
TCP-synack, TCP-rst, TCP-syn-sport, UDP, and UDP-dport,
and these options are case insensitive.
.It Fl r Ar rtraddr
specifies the IP address of the router to use.
.It Fl R
specifies that the record route IP option should be used.
.It Fl s Ar size
specifies the size of the probes to send.
The probe size includes the length of the IP and ICMP headers.
.It Fl S Ar srcaddr
specifies the source address to use in probes.
The address can be spoofed if
.Fl O Ar spoof
is included.
.It Fl T Ar timestamp
specifies that an IP timestamp option be included.
The timestamp option can either be: tsprespec where IP addresses of devices
of interest can be specified; tsonly, where timestamps are embedded by
devices but no IP addresses are included; and tsandaddr, where timestamps
and IP addresses are included by devices in the path.
See the examples section for more information.
.It Fl U Ar userid
specifies an unsigned integer to include with the data collected; the meaning
of the user-id is entirely up to the user and has no effect on the behaviour
of ping.
.It Fl W Ar wait-timeout
specifies how long to wait for responses after the last ping is sent.  By
default this is one second.
.It Fl z Ar tos
specifies the value to use in the IPv4 ToS/DSCP + ECN byte.  By default, this
byte is set to zero.
.El
.\""""""""""""
.Sh DEALIAS OPTIONS
The dealias command is used to send probes for the purpose of alias resolution.
It supports
mercator, where aliases are inferred if a router uses a different
address when sending an ICMP response;
ally, where aliases are inferred if a sequence of probes sent to
alternating IP addresses yields responses with incrementing,
interleaved IP-ID values;
radargun, midarest, and midardisc, where probes are sent to a set of
IP addresses in multiple rounds and aliases are inferred by
post-processing the results;
prefixscan, where an alias is searched in a prefix for a specified IP
address;
and bump, where two addresses believed to be aliases are probed in an
effort to force their IP-ID values out of sequence.
The following options are available for the
.Nm
dealias command:
.Pp
dealias
.\"dealias [-@ start-time] [-f fudge] [-m method] [-o replyc] [-O option]\n"

prefixscan expects one probe definition;
radargun expects at least one probe definition;
midardisc and midarest expect at least two probe definitions;
bump expects two probe definitions.
.It Fl q Ar attempts
specifies how many times a probe should be retried if it does not obtain
a useful response.
.It Fl r Ar wait-round
specifies how many milliseconds to wait between probing rounds with radargun.
.It Fl S Ar schedule
specifies information for a single round in midardisc.
A schedule item is colon separated, as follows:
seconds-since-start:begin-index:end-index.
The seconds-since-start field can include fractions of a second.
The begin-index and end-index identify the begin and end probedef
indexes for the round.
There must be at least two rounds in midardisc.
The length of each round is determined by when the next round is due to
begin; the length of the final round is the same as the length of the
penultimate round.
.It Fl U Ar userid
specifies an unsigned integer to include with the data collected; the meaning
of the user-id is entirely up to the user and has no effect on the behaviour
of dealias.

.Sh DATA COLLECTION FEATURES
.Nm
has three data output formats.
The first is a human-readable format suitable for one-off data collection and
measurement.
The second, known as
.Ic warts ,
is a binary format that records much more meta-data and is more precise than
the human-readable format.
The third format is json, which contains most of the meta-data and is almost
as precise as the
.Xr warts 5
format.
.Nm
produces text output by default, but will produce the other formats if
the user specifies them using
.Fl O Ar warts
or
.Fl O Ar json ,
or if the output file name's suffix is one of these strings.
.Nm
can also produce warts files compressed with gz, bz2, or xz at run-time, if
.Nm
is linked against
.Xr zlib 3 ,
libbz2, or liblzma.
.Pp
.Nm
is designed for Internet-scale measurement, where large lists of targets
are supplied for probing.
.Nm
has the ability to probe multiple lists simultaneously, with each having a
mix rate that specifies the priority of the list.
.Nm
can also make multiple cycles over a list of addresses.
.Pp
When writing output to a
.Xr warts 5
file,
.Nm
records details of the list and cycle that each measurement task belongs
to.
.\""""""""""""
.Sh CONTROL SOCKET
When started with a
.Fl P
or
.Fl U
option,
.Nm
allows inter-process communication via a TCP socket bound to the supplied
port on the local host, or a unix domain socket bound to the supplied location
in the file system.
These sockets are useful for controlling the operation of a long-lived
.Nm

A client may interact with scamper by using
.Xr telnet 1
to open a connection to the supplied port, or
.Xr nc 1
to open a unix domain socket.

.It Ic ERR Ar ...
A line starting with the 3 characters "ERR" indicates an error has occurred.
The rest of the line will contain an error message.
.It Ic OK Ar id-num
A line with the 2 characters "OK" indicates that scamper has accepted
the command.
.Nm
versions after 20110623 return an id number associated with the command,
which allow the task to be halted by subsequently issuing a "halt"
instruction.
.It Ic MORE
A line with just the 4 characters "MORE" indicates that scamper has the
capacity to accept more probing commands to run in parallel.
.It Ic DATA Ar length Ar id-num
A line starting with the 4 characters "DATA" indicates the start of result.
.Ar length
specifies the number of characters of the data, including newlines.

of quoting, such as when giving a probe description with a dealias command.
The following sends UDP probes to alternating IP addresses, one second apart,
and requires the IP-ID values returned to be strictly in sequence.
.Pp
.in +.5i
scamper -O warts -o ally.warts -I "dealias -O inseq -W 1000 -m ally -p '-P udp -i 192.0.2.1' -p '-P udp -i 192.0.2.4'"
.in -.5i
.Pp
Alternatively, the following accomplishes the same, but without specifying the
UDP probe method twice.
.Pp
.in +.5i
scamper -O warts -o ally.warts -I "dealias -O inseq -W 1000 -m ally -p '-P udp' 192.0.2.1 192.0.2.4"
.in -.5i
.Pp
The following command scans 198.51.100.0/28 for a matching alias to 192.0.2.4,
but skips 198.51.100.3.
.Pp
.in +.5i
scamper -O warts -o prefixscan.warts -I "dealias -O inseq -W 1000 -m prefixscan -p '-P udp' -x 198.51.100.3 192.0.2.4 198.51.100.0/28"
.in -.5i
.Pp
The following uses UDP probes to enumerate all per-flow load-balanced paths
towards 192.0.2.6 to 99% confidence; it varies the source port with each
probe.
.Pp
.in +.5i
scamper -I "tracelb -P udp-sport -c 99 192.0.2.6"
.in -.5i
.Pp
The following command connects to the remote controller running
.Xr sc_remoted 1
at foo.example.com:31337, loading the CA certificates specified in the
file.
.Pp
.in +.5i
scamper -R foo.example.com:31337 -O cafile=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
.in -.5i
