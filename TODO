* compile without warnings when the following is passed in CFLAGS
  -Wall -Wno-unneeded-internal-declaration -Wno-unused-const-variable
  -Wno-deprecated-declarations -Wno-unused-parameter -Wshadow -Wextra

* investigate if anyone uses the "source add" functionality and deorbit
  if nobody does

* the warts code sets flags/params_len to zero in a bunch of places, but
  they may have been malloc_zero'd.  go through and figure out.

* document JSON format for all measurements in sc_warts2json

* monitor /etc/resolv.conf for changes.

* try alternate nameserver entries if the first is unresponsive.

* convert sc_bdrmap, sc_erosprober, sc_radargun, sc_tbitblind,
  sc_tbitpmtud, and sc_uptime to libscamperctrl

* in data collection drivers, ask for cycle start and stop records,
  write them out.  done: sc_ally, sc_filterpolicy, sc_pinger,
  sc_prefixprober, sc_prefixscan, sc_speedtrap

* libscamperctrl:
   scamper_task_use should return a pointer to a scamper_task_t *
   scamper_inst_halt -> scamper_task_halt
   unit tests

* libscamperfile:
   scamper_ping_reply_t: addr -> src

* investigate if gettimeofday has to be called so much.

* check that the TOS bits are being set properly on tx.

* ensure that all clients that have observed sources unobserves.

* ensure that all outfiles are closed when scamper shuts down.

* in the scamper.1 man page:
   document control socket quoting rules.
   how to feed adhoc sources
   how to set socket as output for traces
   how does priority value translate into the way lists are mixed
   what is the syntax of responses on control socket
   what is the maximum supported length of source and outfile names and aliases
   how does the cycles value of a source change as cycles are finished
   when does source update take effect
